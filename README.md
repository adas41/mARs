mARs
====

mARs offers a mobile unified search portal that pulls information based on keywords from multiple data feeds on the Web and embeds them in a live feed of the surroundings that the user experiences through the eyes of the phone's camera. mARs runs on Wikitude's AR channel and uses geo-objects and feature tracking to connect data to the scene. At the service layer, mARs features a mashup from multiple sources like Yelp, FourSquare, Facebook, 8Coupons, Yahoo! and SpotCrime to turn raw data into actionable intelligence for the users.
